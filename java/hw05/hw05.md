# Assignment V

Suppose you have a stack S containing n elements and a queue Q that is initially empty.   

Use code fragment to describe how you can use Q to scan S to see if it contains a certain element x, with the additional constraint that your algorithm must return the elements back to S in their original order.   

You may only use S, Q, and a constant number of other primitive variables. 

## Algorithms
We use the queue Q to process the elements in two phases.  
In the first phase, we iteratively pop each element from S and enqueue it in Q, and then we iteratively dequeue each element from Q and push it into S.  
This reverses the elements in S.   
Then we repeat this same process, but this time we also look for the element x. By passing the elements through Q and back to S a second time, we reverse the reversal, thereby putting the elements back into S in their original order.

## Solution Reference
Solution:
```java
  public class WarmUp {
  public static boolean scan(StackObj s, int x){
  QueueObj q= new QueueObj(s.size());
  boolean found =false;
  while(!s.isEmpty()){
  if(((Integer)s.top()).intValue() == x){
  found = true;
  break;
  }
  q.enqueue(s.pop());
  }
  //return the elements back to s
  //in their original order
  while(!q.isEmpty()){
  for(int i=1; i<q.size(); i++)
  q.enqueue(q.dequeue());
  s.push(q.dequeue());
  }
  return found;
  }
  //main method is optional (no marks deducted if missing)
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  StackObj s= new StackObj(10);
  System.out.println(scan(s, 3));
  s.printStack();
  s.push(5);
  s.push(9);
  s.push(1);
  s.push(3);
  s.push(0);
  System.out.println(scan(s, 3));
  s.printStack();
  System.out.println(scan(s, 13));
  s.printStack();
  }
  }
```
