# LAB 9 Queue and List Abstraction

## Objectives
- Get familiar with abstract Queue
- Get familiar with Growable Array-based Array List
- Get familiar with Positional List

## Practice:
What values are returned during the following sequence of queue operations, if executed on an initially empty queue? enqueue(5), enqueue(3), dequeue(), enqueue(2), enqueue(8), dequeue(), dequeue(), enqueue(9), enqueue(1), dequeue(), enqueue(7), enqueue(6), dequeue(), dequeue(), enqueue(4), dequeue(), dequeue().

Suppose you have a deque D containing the numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), in this order. Suppose further that you have an initially empty queue Q. Give a code fragment that uses only D and Q (and no other variables) and results in D storing the elements in the order (1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8).

## Exercise: 
Parentheses matching

Reimplement the ArrayStack class using dynamic arrays to support unlimited capacity.

```
[ ] -> [ ] ->  [ ]
```
