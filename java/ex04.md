Write a Java program that consists of three classes, A, B, and C, such that B extends A and C extends B. 

Each class should define an instance variable named "x" (that is, each has its own variable named x). Describe a way for a method in C to access and set A's version of x to a given value, without changing B or C's version.

Sample solution:
```
public class A <E> {

    private E x;

      ......

    public void setAx(E aX) {

        x = aX;

    }

    public E getAx() {

        return x;

    }

}

 

public class B extends A {

    private int x;

    ......

    public void setBx(int aX) {

        x = aX;

    }

}

 

public class C extends B {

    private int x;

    ......

    public void setCx(int aX) {

        x = aX;

    }

 

    public void setXInA(int aX) {

        super.setAx(aX);

    }

 

    public int getXInA() {

        return super.getAx();

    }

}
```
