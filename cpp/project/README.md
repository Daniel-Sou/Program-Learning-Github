Dear YunYun,

Our group will send the code of C++ about the project later. Besides, I will make the web app of  Tax calculation before the app due date. 

Our original intention to design this app is to help people with multiple or global taxing issues calculate their tax way easier than usual, simply input your region, income and exchange rate between currency and no need to feel headache for the math work.

Our app can calculate HK Macao US taxes and here is our train of thought ，as we considered there are different level income refer to different level of taxes and all three regions have the similar overall tax calculation so we simply using else if condition to apply automatic change of tax rate.

What’s more we noticed Macau has tax return on aged people and us has different tax calculation method for single and married, so we design a little Q&A system to let people choose their ages or whether they want to report their taxes as married or single and that’s all of our basic ideas and functions.
