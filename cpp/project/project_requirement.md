All the tax bracket (tax rates) already provided in the documents that I sent to you before or you can find them at some government website.  

Please do also search for additional information to improve your system as close as possible to the actual situation in the real world, for example, for total income less than a certain level, no global taxing will be charged. 

Besides the program or code, please do prepare a documentation to describe your system that also include, for example, user manual or frequent asked question (FAQ).

Also, on your code, please use the proper format, like indentation, and do make sure that you provide sufficient comments or explanation to let other people to know how to follow the code that you wrote.   

## Bonus Point
For the bonus point part, please create an APP for your Global Tax Calculation, do pay attention to the user interface design for user to conveniently input their data and read the output.
